# Sale-Report-Dashboard
Developed a Power BI sales analytics report for a chocolate company, featuring data modeling, DAX (with time intelligence), KPI tracking, and interactive visuals. The report analyzes sales, costs, profits, product and salesperson performance, and highlights trends like low box shipments and MoM growth.

To enhance insights, a line chart was used to visualize monthly KPI trends, alongside tables highlighting individual salesperson performance against targets and product-level sales. The analysis revealed a total profit of $21M from 6,000 shipments and over 2 million boxes delivered. December 2023 recorded the highest sales at approximately $3.0M, with the US contributing 19% of total sales. One table specifically analyzed product sales, identifying 50% Dark Bites as the top-selling item with $1335K in sales and a profit margin of 27%
